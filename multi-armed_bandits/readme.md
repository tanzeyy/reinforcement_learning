Provide enviroments:
- Stationary environment:
    - $q^*$ for each action is fixed.
- Nonstationary environment:
    - $q^*$ for each action will be changed a little bit according to a normal distribution each time taking action.

Provide following algorithm:
- Sample average
- Constant step size
- Unbiased constant step size
- Gradient ascent with baseline
- Gradient ascent without baseline
